### Goal
In this project, you are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of [Duck Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt). <br>
The basic rules for the my_hunter are as follows:

- the player is a hunter who shoots ducks.<br>
- ducks must appear on the screen and move from one side to another.<br>
- the player can click on them to shoot them.<br>

Being able to manage inputs from the user and to display animated sprites are key skills when you want todevelop basic games.
<br>You will reuse your work for other video game projects, so think about it to make it the
most scalable way.
<br>our project should of course fit the requirements below but we are expecting it to be more than just a
technical demonstration: we want you to think about it as a real game.<br>
This project is probably your first video game ever. Try to have fun making it! You don’t
have to stick to the Duck Hunt theme as long as you respect the set of rules given here.
<br>

### REQUIREMENTS
#### MUST
- The window must be closed using events.<br>
- The program must manage the input from the mouse click.<br>
- The program must contain animated sprites rendered thanks to sprite sheets.<br>
- The program must contain moving (rotating, translating, or scaling) elements.<br>
- The program must accept the “-h” option, then display a short description of the program, and the available user inputs.<br>

#### SHOULD
- Animations and movements in your program should not depend on the speed of your computer.<br>
- Animations and movements in your program should be timed by sfClock elements.<br>
- Your window should stick between 800x600 pixels and 1920x1080 pixels.<br>
- Your window should have a limited frame rate such that it can be compute without lagging.<br>

#### COULD
- The program could have several different levels.<br>
- The program could display the score of the player.<br>
- The program could store the highest score made.<br>
- The program could display a small target under the mouse cursor.<br>

The size of your repository (including the assets) must be as small as possible. Think
about the format and the encoding of your resource files (sounds, musics, images, etc.).
An average maximal size might be 15MB, all included.

### CONCEPTION
Like for any other project, we are obviously asking you to respect the coding style.
For you it will probably be the first time that you make a video game, it will be tempting to code everything
inside of your main function because you are not yet familiar with graphical programming and with the
CSFML. But you should take seriously the principles given in the coding style, they will only help you have
a better project from which you will be able to reuse parts for future game and CSFML projects in this unit.
